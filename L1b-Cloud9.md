# Create a Cloud9 Development Environment

## Create a Cloud9 Development Environment

[AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) is is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.

AWS Cloud9 comes with a terminal that includes sudo privileges to the managed Amazon EC2 instance that is hosting your development environment and a preauthenticated AWS Command Line Interface. This makes it easy for you to directly access AWS services, install additional software, do a git push, or enter commands.

### Navigate to the Cloud9 Console

* In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the Cloud9 console.  One way to do so, is to type "Cloud9" in the service search field and then click on the Cloud9 result.
